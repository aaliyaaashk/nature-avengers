As part of a collaborative group effort focused on satellite-based waste management, I took on the responsibility of creating and hosting our project's website. Our case study delved into leveraging satellite technology to monitor and manage waste effectively across various regions. My role was pivotal in establishing our online presence, where I designed a user-friendly website to showcase our research findings, methodologies, and outcomes. This involved creating interactive features to illustrate satellite data analytics, presenting case studies of successful waste management implementations, and offering insights into the environmental impact of our proposed solutions. By hosting the website, I ensured that our project reached a wider audience, facilitating knowledge dissemination and encouraging engagement from stakeholders interested in sustainable waste management practices. This experience not only honed my web development skills but also underscored the importance of clear and accessible communication in scientific research and environmental initiatives.
